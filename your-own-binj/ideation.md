## Inspiration
* Select population is everyone who needs a way to find new and exciting places because they like to explore. 
* Select population is vendors at LMU’s Wellness Wednesday who need a way to market their products to LMU students.
* Select population is people who are into fitness who want a way to track their calories throughout the day.


## Ideas
* Generate a feed of restaurants/places to go in the area
* Blog based on location where people can post the good places they have been to recommend it to other people
* Create an app that LMU students can download where a feed is generated of vendors at Wellness Wednesday. Feed can be generated based on the student’s likes.
* Create a list of vendors that students can click on to be navigated to the vendor’s website and learn more information.
* Create an app that tracks the calories that someone takes in. The user can search the app for food items which are given a calorie amount in the app
* A blog-style app where a user can input their own activity levels and calorie count that they track and calculate theirselves.
* Exploring different types of places (bars … etc) 
* Increased legitimacy of people visiting the place 
* Finding a place to hang out 
* Finding somewhere with good reviews
